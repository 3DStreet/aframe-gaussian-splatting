Work in progress.

This is an A-Frame implementation of real-time rendering for [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).  
This code is derived from the WebGL implementation developed by [antimatter15](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat).
